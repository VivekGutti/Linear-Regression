Linear Regression (Money Ball)

One of the most compelling stories of sports analytics made popular by the 2011 movie Moneyball, the Oakland Athletics team of 2002 created history by winning 20 consecutive games between August 13 and September 2002. Much of the Oakland Athletics (popularly referred to as the Aâ€™s) success in that season is attributed to their General Manager, Billy Beane and former Assistant General Manager, Paul DePodesta.
